## Introduction
This project involves building a CNN model to classify and identify various diseases in plant leaves. The model helps in early detection and treatment of plant diseases, thereby improving crop yield and quality.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes images of plant leaves with different diseases. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-leaf-disease-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd plant-leaf-disease-detection
    ```
3. Run the model training script:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
4. Use the trained model to make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image path_to_image
    ```

## Model Architecture
The CNN model used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture is designed to extract relevant features from the input images and classify them into different disease categories.

## Training
The model is trained using the dataset with appropriate data augmentation techniques to improve its generalization capabilities. The training process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the classification error.

## Results
The trained model achieves a high accuracy in classifying plant leaf diseases. The results section includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with visualizations of the model's predictions.
